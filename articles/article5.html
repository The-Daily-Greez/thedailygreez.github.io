							Danny's main focus for his campaign is on gun control. The campaign has strong opinions that removing America's guns is a "fool's errand". He wishes to allocated resources into gun safety, citing background checks and monitoring gun distributions as the methods he will implement. Economically, he believes in not limiting economic freedom; he does not believe in raising taxes for the rich, saying that it would be detrimental in the long run due to companies leaving, which would lead to an increased cost of living for both the wealthy and the poor. However, the campaign does believe in regulating companies and corruption in these companies, showing us the strength of using issues from both sides of the political spectrum. On affirmative action, Danny wants to maintain America's stance as a meritocracy, and is firmly against it, stating that it is racist. The campaign acknowledges that the environment is a serious issue right now, but will not make it a main focus; rather, they plan to slowly implement change for it. The campaign believes in legalizing marijuana, reducing drug related criime, increasing revenue due to taxes, and reducing the number of people in jail.

							In regards to foreign policy, the campaign has more concrete ideas and goes much farther in depth. In regards to Syria, Danny is against overthrowing Assad, citing that it would lead to a power vacuum in the Middle East. He states it as a matter of national security vs world security; however, he supports bringing in refugees, albeit with a strong vetting policy. In regards to Russia, Danny believes in re-establishing relationships with Russia "from a position of strength". He supports sanctions on Russia if they keep overstepping their power. In regards to ISIS, Danny supports a more significant US presence in Iraq and Syria, supporting military action via increased airstrikes and more troops, but only as a last resort, wanting the usage of troops to be a joint effort between the U.S. and it's allies. The campaign has stated that they do support arming the Kurds. In regards to immigration,	the campaign believes in enforcing the current immigration policy and stronger border control. In regards to the citizens currently in the U.S., the campaign supports a gradual path to citizenship.

							Danny's central campaign forged from the combination of a liberal and a conservative on the ticket is one that has appeal to all parties; however, it feels like they do not put enough focus on the major issues that plague our nation, with the environment as one example. The economic policy takes hints from both liberals and conservatives; it doesn't believe in taxing the rich, but it does believe in regulating corporations. This is a very strong policy because it attracts both the poor and the upper class; the poor will be controlled less by corporations, while the rich will not have an extreme amount of taxes. The ticket also caters to middle aged Republicans by not limiting the 2nd Amendment; with their affirmative action policy, they cater to the youth vote. While their environmental policy leaves alot to be desired, their marijuana policy offsets their slightly right-leaning campaign by introducing a topic that focuses mainly on the liberal youth. This is still questionable however; marijuana is not a major issue of our nation, and the fact that it takes precedence over more important issues does not bode well for the focus of their campaign.

							In contrast to the theme gleaned from their domestic policies, their foreign policies lean towards the right. The focus on helping refugees aligns with the ideals that founded America, but the same cannot be said for the decision on Assad. How can we consider ourselves a country of freedom when we don't do our best to help those in the Middle East who are oppressed? Many would also argue against their policy for ISIS: there is no proof that we can garner troops from other countries to help if we decide to send troops to stop ISIS, leaving Americans alone to fight ISIS in a seemingly meaningless way - without help from other countries, America WILL have to send a large amount of troops to make any difference, instead of hoping that other countries will fill in those troops. If America can, America will, I guess... On the Russian policy, the campaign does not state how relations with Russia will affect relationships with other organizations, with NATO being the primary one. The immigration policy brings us back to being in line with Danny's campaign - it caters to Republicans who want better immigration security as well as Democrats who want a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.
