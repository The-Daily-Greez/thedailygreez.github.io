							Alec Dai's campaign places a strong focus upon civil rights for women. This is an admirable focus for their campaign; after all, <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womencensus1.html">43% of voters in the 2014 election were women</a>. The campaign plans to repeal the Hyde Amendment, continue Planned Parenthood, and improve sexual education. With economics, the campaign wants to give tax cuts to small businesses and the middle class; for the 1% and large corporations, there will be no tax loopholes and corporations will have to pay an exit tax, "ensuring jobs stay in America." The campaign wishes to redirect part of the defense budget towards the education system, making community colleges free and restricting how much student loans can take from an individual's income, including a forgiveness policy after 20 years. With gun control, they plan to support background checks and mental checks for gun owners, as well as supporting gun safety companies such as <a href="http://www.intelligun.com">Intelligun</a>. Their final policy focuses on the environment; the campaign acknowledges the issue of climate change, and wants to use government funds to help research for cleaner energy methods. He wants to limit the greenhouse gas output of companies, and plans to fine those companies outputting too much pollution.

						<p class="article-body" style="text-indent: 4em">
							Dai's foreign policy focuses on three main topics: Russia, Syria, and immigration. Dai plans to cooperate and negotiate with Russia, mainly on issues such as non nuclear proliferation, while maintaining relationships with NATO. With Syria, Dai plans to make a temporary place for refugees to stay in while they are vetted for entrance into the United States. They plan to cooperate with Silicon Valley in order to understand the workings of ISIS and eliminate their online presence. With Latin America and Immigration, the Dai campaign believes in strong border security, but they also believe that there should be no racial bias in the immigration system. The campaign plans to implement humane laws for immigration, and wants to financially support the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

							The Dai campaign is a very progressive one; true to their slogan, it seems like they do really want to move America forward - at least socially. The campaign absolutely alienates the upper class. This campaign admirably focuses on helping those in America who need it the most - the poor, the middle class, the immigrants, etc. However, this assistance comes at the price of personal freedom for those who are more fortunate, whether due to luck or their own hard work. If a person spends their life to rise to the upper class purely out of their own merit, why should their money be used to the benefit of those less fortunate when they didn't receive the same assistance? If a woman wants to have an abortion, they pay for it - this is what the Hyde Amendment stands for. By repealing it, Dai is specifically providing assistance to those who cannot afford it, but removing the freedom of whether a wealthy individual wants to support abortion or not. This kills the pro-life choice, and by extension, what America stands for - freedom of choice.
						</p>
						<p class="article-body" style="text-indent: 4em">
							Dai's education policy is a often proposed one, but is very good; anybody who supports our youth, regardless of personal political stance, can support it. Economically, corporations look like they should be worried about how an exit tax would be implemented, but they aren't due to a lack of substantial information on it's implementation. The gun control policy is very neutral but progressive - it will make guns safer for all, while upkeeping the values of the 2nd Amendment. The pollution limit for companies seems to be unfair - some companies due to their nature produce greenhouse gases, while some companies produce none solely based on what the company makes. This seems like Dai is forcing a change for the benefit of the environment, but the limitations it might impose might be detrimental in the long run.
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Dai's immigration policy is a very strong one that is beneficial and doesn't go against the beliefs of either Republicans or Democrats - it is a humane policy true to America's beliefs that everyone can get behind, especially those immigrants that are directly affect by it. The policy on Russia also focuses towards peace and cooperation, which is a very good sign for the foreign policy of the campaign. While the Syria and ISIS policy are unique from what any other candidate offers, the question still remains - Where are we going to find a place for the refugees, and how are we going to pay for it? Contrary to popular belief, we can only tax the rich and reduce the defense budget by so much. The campaigns's promise to implement technology, noting the cooperation with Intelligun and Silicon Valley as in line with their slogan.
