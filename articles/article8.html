						<p class="article-body" style="text-indent: 4em">
							But in all seriousness, I feel the voters brought up some pertinent questions during the Town Hall; I was impressed by the preparation the campaigns exhibited yesterday. Here is a majority of the debate paraphrased by The Daily Greez.
						</p>

						<div style="width: 50% ; margin: 0 auto"><hr></div>

						<p class="article-body">
							Question: Why should the rich get more money take away than the poor if they worked so hard to get there?
							<br>
							Alec: America is a country of equality, and those more fortunate should help give back to the country. Besides, larger taxes for the rich represent an almost negligible amount to their total riches.
							<br>
							Calvin: Not everyone at the top makes their money from hard work; for example, people who inherit money from their parents didn't work for it.
							<br>
							Danny: The richer shouldn't be punished for revitalizing America; the whole notion that the rich don't pay enough taxes is rhetoric.
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							Question: How will you combat companies leaving to places where there are less taxes?
							<br>
							Alec: I propose an exit tax based on the value of the company.
							<br>
							Danny: An exit tax goes against all American principles. Why would anyone start a business in America if they have to pay to control it? We can't expect that to fix the economy. However, we do believe in tackling corruption.
							<br>
							Calvin: I also believe that we need an exit tax; furthermore, we need to tax all the business in America, because our market is a huge asset. We also need better trade deals.
							<p class="article-body quoted">
								Editor Note: The exit tax was not specified anywhere in their campaign at the time of writing this article.
							</p>
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							Question: What are your thoughts on gun control?
							<br>
							Danny: People have the right to bear arms; we shouldn't attempt to confiscate guns because it would be ineffective to do so. We need adequate safety rules, and implementation of tech on guns, but should not ban certain types of weapons.
							<br>
							Calvin: There are too many mass shootings, we do need stricter gun control in order to prevent these from happening.
							<br>
							Alec: The people have the right to bear arms; however we need gun control. We need background checks, and integration with the national criminal database. We will work with Silicon Valley companies such as Intelligun in order to help improve gun safety.
							<p class="quoted article-body">Editor Note: Intelligun is NOT a Silicon Valley company.</p>
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							Question: How will we deal with unfair imprisonment of those who violate drug laws?
							<br>
							Calvin: More incarcerated people means more taken away from the workforce for an unfair reason. We need to completely reform our drug policy; notably, we have to take marijuana out of Schedule 1 drugs. Furthermore, we need to legalize and regulate it to prevent future unfair imprisonments. As of now, we need to commute the sentences of prisoners currently doing time for marijuana related offenses; to tackle the larger problem of reintegrating prisoners into society, we need to reform the prison system because most prisoners who get out of prison don't get a job and end up becoming repeat offenders. These people need to be properly trained, and this is an important issue.
							<br>
							Danny: This problem goes farther than marijuana, involving other drugs. It is heavily based in impoverished communities, and needs to be tackled with a focus on legalizing marijuana.
							<br>
							Alec: We do support legalizing marijuana; it will bring over 22 billion dollars into the economy.
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							Topic: Police
							<br>
							Calvin: We need to make police forces reflect the community; by making the police task more diverse through the implementation of community police, we already make a huge improvement. Furthermore, we need to stop the militarization of police weapons; this will help the police force present a frendlier front to the public. I believe that body cameras should be mandated for all policemen in the interest of speedy justice.
							<br>
							Danny: We need to promote education programs for both police and the public; it will help us acknowledge that the police are here to protect us, and are good people regardless of the bad apples that dominate the media's image of the entire police force. However, we do need to deal with these bad apples; I propose a much stronger vetting program for hiring cops.
							<br>
							Alec: We need to have courses to recognize unconscious bias. Danny's education programs are useless, but interesting. We need to realize that everyone has implicit racial or social biases, and we need to people aware of that.
							<p class="article-body quoted">Editor Note: Wow. Even though this was shrugged off by all parties with laughter, it still shows a blatant disrespect for the ideas presented. I would be fine with this if an explanation was offered on why it was ineffective, but none was mentioned. This brings how fit Alec is to be president into question.</p>
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Danny: Education is NOT useless; police should be trained on certain issues. We have to implement something REAL (referencing Alec's proposal) from an educational standpoint. We can't assume that all officers are racist; we have to educate them and not treat them like they ARE inherently racist. 
							<br>
							Calvin: We did not say police officers are racist.
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Question: What are your plans concering the issues of hate crimes against minorities?
							<br>
							Danny: Hate crimes are terrible; America should not have anti-LGBT movements, anti-feminism movements, anti-black movements, or anything of the sort. America is a place for all of us. We need to treat these cases very, very adequately.
							<br>
							Alec: It's hard to substantialize how we will provide equality for all; Michelle Obama provides a good role model to follow. She went on children's television and spoke to the public to show the children what she was about. This is what a good president needs to do.
							<br>
							Calvin: It is absolutely unacceptable to discriminate against others, and we need to stop this.
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Topic: Affirmative Action
							<br>
							Danny: America has always been a meritocracy, and should always be a meritocracy. My family escaped the oppressive Soviet regime and came to America with nothing. My dad worked at a car wash for 2 dollars an hour until he was able to setup his own business. He showed that America is great, and that it's the land of opportunity. If you will it, it's not a dream; you can achieve your goals.
							<p class="article-body quoted">Wow - a really powerful anecdote that shows the strong convictions behind some of his policies.</p>
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Alec: Affirmative action is necessary. Racial bias does exist, and the schoolhouse to jailhouse pipeline is very real. Blacks have the lowest graduation rate in America. Equality has to be there, and in America it's not.
							<br>
							Calvin: Affirmative action is necessary; many from minorities come from a low socioeconomic status; history is one of oppression.
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Topic: Environment
							<br>
							Calvin: America's infrastructure is crumbling. Focusing on green energy will create millions of good paying jobs that contribute to the economy. Climate change is a real threat; investing in green energy will help protect our environment, while creating thousands of long term sustainable jobs. It will also invest in our middle class and will help close the income gap.
							<br>
							Danny: Wow, it's like Alec and Calvin are the same person.
							<p class="article-body quoted">Editor Note: While this does have basis, I don't think he has any right to say this without actually countering either of the campaigns he says are "the same".</p>
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Alec: I agree with Calvin; the solar industry has grown 53% in the last 4 years. Green energy is something I will promote in terms of infrastructure and incone equality.
							<br>
							Danny: I believe in GRADUAL change; we can't force people to buy an electric car, or force companies to comply with a carbon tax (Alec's policy) right off the bat. There are so many jobs people rely on; enabling green energy could create jobs, but not enough for the people that currently work on fossil fuel programs. We need to promote awareness that the environment is changing, but we can't force them into it. We have a centered position on this; what both campaigns propose is quick and radical.
							<br>
							Calvin: Nothing we have proposed is radical; we propose gradually taking money from fossil fuel subsidies in order to invest in green energy. People in Kentucky were working in the fossil fuel industry; it is one example of a place that has lots of potential in regards to green energy. We can slowly move those who are contributing to climate change to green energy fields.
							<p class="article-body quoted">Editor Note: I believe Calvin's environmental policy is the best of both Alec's and Danny's which bodes well for their possible election.</p>
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Final Thoughts
							<br>
							Alec: Danny's "central" campaign is just a means of pandering; according to Matthew So, Danny's VP leads liberal.
							<br>
							Danny: You should vote for two candidates that are willing to work together to lead America, instead of having them both on the same side.
							<br>
							Calvin: < This was not recorded by The Daily Greez. >
