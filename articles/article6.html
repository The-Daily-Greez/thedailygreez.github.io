							Calvin's campaign mainly focuses upon investing in the youth of our country by making education affordable to all. Their education policy wants to increase Pell grants and government scholarships, while trying to make all community colleges free for families making under $100k. He wishes to reduce the percent of student loan interest rates by half, attempting to put student loans under bankruptcy law. He plans to pay for this via redirection of funds and a fraction of a percent tax on Wall Street speculation. The campaign raises the environment and energy as one issue; they wish to reduce fossil fuels. This will be done by ending fossil fuel subsidies and by enacting a carbon tax to cut pollution. They also support a ban on fracking. Along with this, they will invest in renewable energy infrastructure, citing that it will create new jobs. Their third major issue is sexual assault; Calvin believes that all victims of sexual assault have the right to be heard and to have their claims taken seriously. Actual changes he plans to implement are better police funding to reduce the rape kit backlog and expand counseling services for victims, alongside nationwide sexual violence education. In regards to justice, Calvin will ensure offenders of sexual crimes are properly punished and rehabilitated. He also plans to fight against higher education institutions attempting to cover up sexual assault in order to preserve their image, and wants to allow non-campus law enforcement to investigate rape cases inside colleges. Economically, they want to help small businesses and break up monopolies. They also focus on family rights, allowing parents to take off more time from work, instituting a mandated minimum paid sick leave.

							When considering foreign policy, Calvin's campaign focuses on a diplomatic yet bold response when it comes to Russia. He believes in having strong ties with NATO to deter Russian aggression. In the Middle East, Calvin plans to continue economic sanctions on Assad and continuing the limited presence of U.S. forces. He believes the only true solution to the conflict in Syria is diplomacy, advocating against a no-fly zone and sending in troops. He also wishes to resolve the refugee crisis, but does not think our current vetting process needs any changes. On immigration from Latin America, Calvin states that "Diversity has always been one of America's greatest strengths". He proposes increasing the amount of legally accepted immigrants from Latin American countries, discouraging people from entering illegally and allowing the government to keep tabs on the amount of people entering the country. He proposes a speedy path to citizenship for illegal immigrants currently in the U.S, and wants immigration laws to be enforced humanely, not wishing to break up families due to deportations.

							Calvin's earlier statement on his choice of VP doesn't align with his policies; while he says Andrew will help the campaign move towards a more centrist position, we do not see that reflected in their stances. Most or all of these positions cater to a liberal viewpoint, and there is little to none that appeals to Republicans here. Their position on taxes and education cater to the young vote, and doesn't get the vote of Republicans who support Wall Street. The fraction of a tax on Wall Street speculation Calvin proposes was originally coined by Senator Bernie Sanders - and has been debunked as a bad idea. "Wall Street speculation" is a broad term that one would think applies to the rich making money off trading stocks; however, the tax will apply to everyone that trades. This includes endowments that colleges use for a majority of their funding, and the small amounts of stock that your average person invests in. Looking at foreign policy, they focus mainly on a humane and diplomatic route for all the issues. This works amazingly for immigration and Russia; however, when it comes to the Assad regine in Syria, not so much. Diplomacy has been an ongoing tactic, and has been ineffective.
