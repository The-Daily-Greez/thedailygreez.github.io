						</div>

						<p class="article-body" style="text-indent: 4em">
						As the editor of The Daily Greez, I've been exposed to all three campaigns through both direct interaction and through the ideas they represent. I admire the amount of effort that all of the campaigns have put into this election so far, and it has been difficult to assess which one campaign will serve our country best. After intense pondering, I have chosen to endorse Calvin Vuong, for a number of reasons, starting with the effort he has put into making his campaign.
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
							Calvin's choice of campaign staff shows the amount of care and thought he has put into creating a campaign not just to win, but to be a relevant force in improving our country in years to come. Here are some firsthand accounts of the effect Calvin has had upon his staff, taken from the survey which was completely confidential.
						</p>
						<p class="article-body quoted">
						"As the son of two diplomats, my suggestions on foreign policy are always respected and considered, even if not always accepted. This, in turn, makes me feel very relevant in the campaign and confident that my words matter."
						<br><br>
						"He has constantly sought advice from everyone, trying his best to change his speech patterns to be more engaging, even staying afterschool on multiple occasions to practice. I know Calvin may be the least recognizable amongst freshman but that is why we put in more than double the effort into campaigning compared to the other two. It saddens and frustrates me that the other two campaigns have been constantly dismissing us or deeming us as weak, when we clearly have a winning shot."
						<br><br>
						"...he would always ask whether or not we agreed with the ideas. This really does show a lot about his character—how he’s considerate and willing to compromise and I think this is a really important trait to have in a president. I’m really glad I was chosen for his campaign and I support him 100% of the way."
						<br><br>
						"Despite his calm and collected outward image, he harbors a passion for his beliefs that becomes readily apparent when engaging with others on a personal level."
						</p>
						<p class="article-body">
						Here is where we truly get a sense of who Calvin is as a person; not by how he appears to the public, but by how he appears to his staff. We can see how passionate he is about his beliefs, and how he connects to his staff; we know these ideals he argues for are not just his own, but rather those of his entire team. It is a testament to his cooperation and humbleness that he fervently argues for ideals that may not be his own, because he recognizes those policies are for the good of the people.
						</p>
						<h1 class="less-aggressive-header"><br>VOTERS:</h1>
						<p class="article-body">
							<b>Calvin is not a unique candidate.</b> He is not proposing anything radically new that will fix our country; he is not going to win you over with cookies or a strong voice.
							<br><br>
							But regardless of whether you vote for him or not, he is fighting for <i>you</i>.
							<br><br>
							He has shown time and time again how much he cares: not about his own policies, not about winning the election, but about you: the voter. I will not tell you to vote for him; I simply ask you to vote with the future of your country in mind. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="mildly-aggressive-header"><br>I endorse Calvin Vuong for President of the United States of America: not for my beliefs, but for America's.</h1>
