						<p class="article-body">
							 Today, the campaigns made an effort to determine what policies and issues they would focus on; here is information on the Danny - Esther ticket and the Calvin - Andrew ticket. The Alec - Dasha ticket was not available to release concrete information on their campaign as of today, but will reveal their full platform along with the other two campaigns tomorrow. All of the following information is subject to change.
							 <br>
							 Without further ado...
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							Danny's campaign will be a centrist one leaning towards the right; the candidate has stated he wishes to redefine the notion of what being a conservative means. He plans to have "a common sense concise platform", striving for a millenial-influenced viewpoint on Republicanism. The campaign believes in certain liberal issues, as well as certain conservative issues; they wish to combine the most important issues raised by both parties. According to a leak from one of Danny's campaign staff, an issue they might be focusing upon is gun control. However, there is no way to confirm this as of now.
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							<br>
							I think that this is a interesting and well-thought out campaign. By being a right leaning campaign, the ticket mantains a focus on conservative issues without alienating millenial voters. The success of this campaign depends on how well the candidate can execute this platform that has been laid out.
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							The Calvin - Andrew campaign will mainly focus on the issue of making college tuition affordable for all students. The ticket wishes to make public community colleges free. The campaign acknowledges that it will be costly, but believes that investing in the country's future is the best possible investment we can make. Some ideas they propose for managing the cost are collaborating with state governments, and introducing a fraction of a percent tax on Wall Street speculation.
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							<br>
							The topic the Calvin - Andrew campaign raises as their main focus is an interesting one; it caters heavily towards the youth vote, who are an especially important part of this election. As of now, it isn't possible to make a judgement of their campaign as a whole until we can see where the other topics of their campaign will lie on the political spectrum. However, we can see from the earlier press release that their Vice President will help make the ticket lean more towards the center. Based on current information, I believe this to be a moderately left leaning campaign.
						</p>

						<p class="article-body">
							Both campaigns have a clear focus on gaining millenial votes; we will soon find out how the Alec - Dasha campaign wants to gain the vote of our country's youth.
